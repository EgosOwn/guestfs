# go libguestfs bindings

This is an unofficial repo containing the [libguestfs go binding](https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs).

The libguestfs team auto generates bindings for their C library, but does not host the resulting go bindings in any git repo.

This was taken from the source tar ball for libguestfs-1.50.0

I tested it with Go 1.19.12 on amd64.
